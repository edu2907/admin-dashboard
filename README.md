# Admin Dashboard

An admin dashboard example page, made for [Admin Dashboard Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

The intent of the project is simply to test the skills I learned in Intermediate
HTML and CSS course so far, specially CSS Grid, and in overall, it was simple to do
it, despite some small problems and bugs. The page isn't responsive to mobile
and tablet devices, but it should fit well in desktop screens.
